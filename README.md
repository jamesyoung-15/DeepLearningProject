# DeepRL MarioKart64
My project that uses Deep Reinforced Learning to play MarioKart64. Specfically, the project uses Deep Q-Learning as described by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602). The project uses debugger build of [Mupen64Plus emulator](https://mupen64plus.org/docs/) and wraps it with Farama's [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library to simplify training.

## Instructions

### Setup
See [this page](./setup.md) for full instructions to setup.

### Usage

## More About the Project

### Gym Environment
There is an existing Gym Environments for Mupen64Plus: [gym-mupen64plus](https://github.com/bzier/gym-mupen64plus). However I decided create my own environment wrapper to be able read game memory.

### Emulator
For emulating N64 I used Mupen64Plus (M64P) with Glide64mk plugin. To enable debugging to access the memeory maps, build the M64P from source with debugging flag. I used Glide64mk instead of Rice video plugin as Rice video plugin stuttered on my system.

#### Used Keyboard commands
Default: [Documentation](https://mupen64plus.org/wiki/index.php/KeyboardSetup)
