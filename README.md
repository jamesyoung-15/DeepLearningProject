# DeepRL MarioKart64
Ongoing course project that tries to use deep reinforced learning to play MarioKart64.

## Setup
Recommend use Python virtual environment. Install requirements from `requirements.txt` with Pip. Project setup for Linux (Arch btw).

### Creating and Activating Environment
[Venv Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Creating venv:
``` bash
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Activating venv:
``` bash
source <venv>/bin/activate
```

Installing requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Emulator
Using Mupen64Plus with Glide64mk plugin. On Arch installed [this](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mupen64plus-video-parallel-git) package from AUR. Either use parallel video plugin or Glide64mk instead of Rice video plugin as Rice video plugin stuttered on my system.

### Used Keyboard commands

## Gym Environment
There are existing Gym Environments for Mupen64Plus: [gym-mupen64plus](https://github.com/bzier/gym-mupen64plus) . However I decided create my own environment wrapper to read game memory.





## Memory Map
Todo: use memory to get player info for more info (eg. use current progress, speed, etc.).

|Address|Info|
|--- |--- |
|0x1644D0: | Current progress |
|0x0F6BBC: | Velocity |
|0x0F69A4: | X Position |
|0x0F69AC: | Y Position |
|0xF69A8: | Z Position |

## Reading from Mupen64Plus memory
Use Mupen64Plus C++ API. To store into Python variable, will use Python ctype.
