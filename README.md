# DeepRL MarioKart64
Warning: Useless repo failed project. 

My project that fails to use Deep Reinforced Learning to play MarioKart64. Specfically, the project uses Deep Q-Learning as described by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602). The project uses debugger build of [Mupen64Plus emulator](https://mupen64plus.org/docs/) and wraps it with Farama's [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library to simplify training.

Unfortunately agent is unable to even complete a single lap after 12 hours of training :(. May pickup again if I feel like it so will keep the repo up.

## Instructions
Project requires Linux. Tested with Arch Linux and Debian-based distros (eg. Ubuntu, PopOS).
### Setup
Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/DeepQLKart64
cd DeepQLKart64
```

Install Python packages with Pip (recommend using Python virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build Mupen64Plus and plugins from source:
``` bash
cd mupen64plus-build
# allow script execution
chmod +x m64p_get.sh m64p_install.sh
# install mupen64plus git repo
./m64p_get.sh
# compile and build with debugging option
./m64p_build.sh DEBUG=1 DEBUGGER=1
# copy the core and plugin libraries over to m64py
./copy_files.sh
```

Make sure to have a copy of a Mario Kart 64 ROM with file type `.n64`. Move it to the `rom` folder in this directory. Also move the game states to 

See [this page](./setup.md) for full details on instructions to setup.

### Usage
For my own model, use `custom_train.py`. For using Stable Baselines 3, see `dqn_stable_baselines.py`.

```bash
python3 custom_train.py
```

## More About the Project

### Gym Environment
I decided create my own environment wrapper to be able read game memory. There is an existing Gym Environments for Mupen64Plus: [gym-mupen64plus](https://github.com/bzier/gym-mupen64plus) but it lacks the option to read in-game memory addresses which gives information like speed of kart.

### Emulator
For emulating N64 I used Mupen64Plus (M64P) with Glide64mk plugin. To enable debugging to access the memeory maps, build the M64P from source with debugging flag. I used Glide64mk instead of Rice video plugin as Rice video plugin stuttered on my system.

#### Used Keyboard commands
Default: [Documentation](https://mupen64plus.org/wiki/index.php/KeyboardSetup). 

#### Memory Map
Todo: use memory to get player info for more info (eg. use current progress, speed, etc.).

|Address|Info|
|--- |--- |
|0x1644D0 | Current progress |
|0x0F6BBC | Velocity |
|0x0F69A4 | X Position |
|0x0F69AC | Y Position |
|0x0F69A8 | Z Position |
|0x80164390 | Lap (starts at -1) |

#### Reading from Mupen64Plus memory
Use Mupen64Plus C++ API. To store into Python variable, will use Python ctype.
